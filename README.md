# SimpleGeometry
A simple python library to calculate variables of shapes with only one input.

# Commands

formulas(shape) -- formulas allows you to rewiew the formulas of either a square or a circle (if you forgot them)
allesumcircle(r=,d=,c=,a=) -- allesumcircle allows you to input either the radius (r) or the diameter (d) or the circumference (c) or the area (a) and gain access to all the other variables with the simple command. you can also turn printing off by doing Print=False.
allesumsquare(s=,a=,p=,d=, Print=False) -- allesumsquare allows you to input either the sides (s) or the area (a) or the perimeter (p) or the diagonal (d) and gain access to all the other variables. you can also turn printing off by doing Print=False.
Variables that come with this library:
pi -- the pi variable is just your standard pi (3.14159265358979323846264338)
